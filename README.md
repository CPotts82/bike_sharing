## Analysis Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to study the CitiBike Data from New York City's bikeshare program to help investors decide if a bike sharing program could be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis studies how the bike share program works in New York City to see how it could possibly transition over to  Des Moines. 
### Background 

![General Information](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106348899/190514853-63a4b617-a115-468d-957d-36490b9259a3.png)

This dashboard shows multiple visualizations that represent important background pieces of information for this analysis.  The analysis focused on the citibike data taken from the month of August. At the top of the visualization it shows the total number of bike rides for the month of August to be 2,344,224.  The bar graph underneath August bike trips shows the peak hours during the month.  Overall, the busiest hours were during business hours with peak times in the morning and evening when people would be commuting to and from work. 

At the bottom of the dashboard there are two graphs: a pie chart and a line graph.  These charts visualize the different types of users in the bike share program.  There are subscribers and customers. Subscribers have a subscription to the program and pay monthy or yearly.  Customers are not necessarily consistent users and pay per use of the bikes. The line chart shows the number of users for the month of August by the age of user, and further filtered by the type of user, customer or subscriber. This graph shows a big jump in users for customers born in 1969 and jump for subscribers born at this time as well. (This is a bit odd and should go through additional analysis.) There is also a steady increase in the number of subscribers born from 1975 to 1991.
