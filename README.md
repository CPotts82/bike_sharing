## Analysis Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to study the CitiBike Data from New York City's bikeshare program to help investors decide if a bike sharing program could be successful in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis studies how the bike share program works in New York City to see how it could possibly transition over to  Des Moines. One of the potential investors has requested a bike trip analysis to gain more insight into this proposed program. 
### Background 

![General Info](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106348899/190530581-21a9ff59-9d23-4a25-b6ff-b4b5b88dd0e7.png)

This dashboard shows multiple visualizations that represent important background pieces of information for this analysis.  The analysis focused on the citibike data taken from the month of August. At the top of the visualization it shows the total number of bike rides for the month of August to be 2,344,224.  The bar graph underneath August bike trips shows the peak hours during the month.  Overall, the busiest hours were during business hours with peak times in the morning and evening when people would be commuting to and from work. 

At the bottom of the dashboard there are two graphs: a pie chart and a line graph.  These charts visualize the different types of users in the bike share program.  There are subscribers and customers. Subscribers have a subscription to the program and pay monthy or yearly.  Customers are not necessarily consistent users and pay per use of the bikes. The line chart shows the number of users for the month of August by the age of user, and further filtered by the type of user, customer or subscriber. This graph shows a big jump in users for customers born in 1969 and jump for subscribers born at this time as well. (This is a bit odd and should go through additional analysis.) There is also a steady increase in the number of subscribers born from 1975 to 1991.

## Results
Each of the following visualizations shows a piece of the bike trip analysis requested by the investors. Underneath each graph is an explanation and the results of the specific piece of the overall anlaysis.

Checkout Times for Users shows the trip durations for all users, both subscriber and customers throughout the month of August. This chart can be filtered by the number of hours per trip duration.  The majority of bike trips are less than 1 hour and more specifically approximately 5 minutes long. There is a sharp increase in the amount of trips that range from 1 minute to 6 minutes. After the 6 minute peak, there is a sharp then steady decline in the length of bicycle trips.  Most trips are under an hour though there are a sufficient number of bike trips that are over 1 and 2 hours long.

This next chart is almost identical to the previous one with the exception that it includes a breakdown of gender of the users in the trip duration analysis. It is very apparent from this chart that males are the primary users of the NYC bike share program.
